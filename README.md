# Example start code for project-1

Simple project layout which you can use for the first project.
You dont have to use this, and if you do, feel free to twist it any way you like.

## How to use

If you plan to use this for the first semester project, start by adding the "menu structure" required by YOUR project, and remove the demo code meant only as an introduction to this setup.

## IMPORTANT
Make sure you understand that this is not a *router*
